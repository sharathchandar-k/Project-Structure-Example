# Project-Structure-Example
In JavaScript projects, the project structure can vary significantly depending on the type of project (e.g., front-end, back-end, or a full-stack application), the framework or library you're using, and your personal preferences. Here's a basic example of a front-end web application structure using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

project-example/\
│\
├── index.html\
├── style.css\
├── script.js\
├── images/\
│\
├── node_modules/ (if using Node.js and npm)\
│\
├── package.json (if using Node.js and npm)\
├── package-lock.json (if using Node.js and npm)\
│\
├── README.md

### Explanation of the structure:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for your web application.
- **script.css**: The main CSS files for styling your web pages.
- **script.js**: The main JavaScript file where you write your application logic.
- **images/**: Store image files used in your application, such as logos or other graphics.
- **README.md**: A documentation file that explains the project, its structure, and how to run it or work on it.

The choice of structure and tools also depends on the specific requirements and technologies you're using, so feel free to adapt and extend this structure to meet your project's needs.
